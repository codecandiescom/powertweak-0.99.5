powertweak for Debian
----------------------

In Debian powertweak is split into a number of smaller packages:

  powertweakd      - The powertweak daemon.
  powertweak-gtk   - GTK GUI to configure hardware tweaks.
  powertweak-text  - Text UI to configure hardware tweaks.
  powertweak-extra - Additional backends.

The powertweak convenience package depends on all these packages and can
be used to cause all components to be installed.
