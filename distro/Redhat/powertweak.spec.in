  [powertweak-0.1.17-1]
- Someone found a nasty bug in 0.1.16 where changing from a
  2.4 kernel back to a 2.2 kernel meant the system died when
  Powertweak was run.
- This tree is no longer actively developed.
  If you want new features check out the CVS tree, or wait
  until the new release sometime _really_ soon now.

* Thu Aug 31 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>

  have a recent version of PCI Utilities installed.
- Note, that with this release, you now NEED the following..
  PCI Utilities (At least version 2.1.0)
  LibXML (At least version 1.8.0)

* Tue Apr 12 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.12-1]
- Memory management tweaking now added.
- Before now, it was possible that not all the buttons were displayed
  in the Filesystem & Network tabs. [Nicholas Dronen]
- GUI now resizes properly. [Arjen van de Ven]

* Mon Mar 27 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.11-1]
- Fixed an ugly bug where gPowertweak created config files
  that would cause the computer not to boot anymore!
- Added workaround for an egcs bug.
  Just when I thought it was safe to use a 'safe' compiler,
  I'm proven wrong, and have to compile tune.c with -O0
- Versioning works again.
- No longer complains when it finds an empty config file.
  This is on request from the Debian maintainer.
- When a tweak isn't found in the config file, it now skips
  to the next tweak. Before it skipped the rest of the device.
- Some small cleanups in the Matrox extended info code.
- Other small fixes..

* Mon Mar 13 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.10-1]
- The code base restructure is now almost complete.
  No more #including of .c files. Every part of the code now
  uses Makefiles which makes development a lot easier.
  v0.1.11 will probably feature the autoconfing I've been promising
  for way too long.
- The textmode GUI is starting to take shape, and is almost in a
  state where I'm happy to call it 'usable'. There are still many
  bugs in this, and lots of stuff left to code. Hopefully we'll
  start getting this usable in the next few revisions.

* Mon Mar  6 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.9-1]
- Major restructuring of the codebase.
  Some extra makefiles added, and lots of code moved around
  to new directories. All code now lives in a src directory.
- Textmode ncurses GUI.
  Incomplete, and totally usable but there's a primitive codebase.
  Segfaults everywhere. If you can help debug this, I'd be happy.
  So, feel free to join in the hacking on this, as we race to
  complete it before Linus releases kernel 2.4.0 !

* Mon Feb 28 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.8-1]
- More GUI changes.
  The old menus got moved into a 'hardware' menu.
  Added several new menus to the tree.
- Extended the /proc/sys tuning code lots.
  - Can now save /proc/sys tweaks.
  - Many new /proc/sys tweaks added.
- Improved Matrox support.
  - Extended info changed to support all other Matrox cards.
  - Now uses mmap instead of reading a chunk of /dev/mem into
    an internal buffer.

  [powertweak-0.1.7-1]
- Huge changes in the GUI code.
  - Increased functionality.
	You should now be able to generate a config file
	using the GUI. In this release generation of
	config entries for /proc tweaking are not enabled
	this will be fixed in v0.1.8
  - Lots of ugly code removed/fixed.
  - Information on each tweak added.
- Ability to display extended info for PCI devices.
  Currently only Matrox G200 supported.
- Fix for the BX problems introduced in v0.1.6
- One more LX tweak added.
- Two more /proc tweaks added.
- Config file parser slightly improved.
  Now allows tags to act as booleans, and not need =value
- Documentation updates.
- Source code formatting, cleaning, commenting etc..

* Sun Jan 16 2000 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.6-1]
- Extra chipset support:
  - Intel TX tweaks extended
  - Intel LX support added
  - Intel BX support added
- Tuning of entries in /proc/sys

  [powertweak-0.1.5-1]
- Now includes pci.ids
  The new PCILIB is incompatable with old versions of pci database.
  This means that until PCILIB becomes a dynamic library, I'll have
  to start including it with Powertweak.
  This is the main reason that this release came out so soon, to
  stop people constantly mailing me to tell me about it!
- Some more VP3/MVP3 issues resolved courtesy of Richard Pruen.
- The GUI should now compile, and run on Alphas, Sparc's etc..

* Tue Jul 20 1999 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [powertweak-0.1.1-1]
- Initial RPM Build.
