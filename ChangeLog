v0.99.3 [Release 21. -- The 'voon' release ]

- Bugfixes:
	- Daemon now handles >1 HUP.
	- Daemon applies settings on getting a HUP.
	- SMART code doesn't keep device fd open anymore.
	- Make install no longer overwrites existing config files.
	- CDROM backend now respects min/max settings in /proc
	- CPU backend now handles SMP boxes properly.
	- CPU backend handles steppings correctly.
	- Close open fds lying around at daemon creation time (Debian bug 111840)

- New Features:
	- Tweaks that have changed value since the daemon has loaded
	  now reflect their current state in the UIs.
	- Subtrees are now sorted alphabetically in UIs.

	  at init time, not every time a tweak is allocated.
	  End result : Lower backend memory usage.
	- All backends had destructors auditted & cleaned up.
	- Addition of GetValueRaw() method to tweak struct meant
	  backend init paths got much cleaner.
	- Removal of lots of useless/old/duplicated code.

v0.99.0 [Release 18. -- The 'Time to rethink everything' release -- "PT-0_99_0" ]

	This release brought about a complete rewrite.
	Some of the major changes since the last public release are...

	- By default, Powertweak now starts as a daemon that should be
	  run on bootup. (Old behaviour still possible with --no-daemon)
	  The GUI now communicates with the daemon instead of doing
	  the tweaking itself.
	- Backends are now completely modular plugin libraries.
	  This allows for easier cross-platform usage, and a cleaner API.
	- Profiles.
	  Tell Powertweak "This is a webserver" and have it auto-tune.
	- Rewritten /proc/sys tuning backend.
	- PCI backend now uses XML files to describe tweaks.
	  Several chipsets added since 0.1.17 release.
	- Addition of a disk elevator tuning backend.
	- CPU register tuning is now possible, as long as you have the
	  cpuid/msr drivers in your kernel (2.2.18, or 2.4.0test)
	- Working text mode user interface.

	Note, that with this release, you now NEED the following..
	PCI Utilities (At least version 2.1.0)
	LibXML (At least version 1.8.8, or 2.1.0)
