Daemon.
~~~~~~~
  Why a daemon?
  - Initially to reduce the amount of code duplication.
  - Features are planned where the daemon will be able to
    continually monitor events, and adjust accordingly.
  - You don't have to run Powertweak as a daemon.
    Place "powertweakd --no-daemon" in your startup, and it'll work just
	as version 0.1.17 did. Note, that in this release there is no difference
	in functionality. Later versions will feature extended functionality when
	run in daemon mode.

CPU Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~
  Why doesn't the CPU backend show any tweaks when I click its tab ?

  - You don't have the MSR driver loaded.
    For this you'll need to be running at least kernel version
    2.2.18pre or 2.4.0test
  - If you're using a vendor supplied kernel, it's likely these
    are built as modules. You need to do the following commands..
       modprobe cpuid
	   modprobe msr
  - There isn't anything possible to be tuned on your CPU.
  - Some CPUs (notably Cyrix) have their registers accessed in a
    different way, support for this will be added at a later time.
  - Your CPU is currently unsupported.
    Most notable here is AMD Athlon. The register level information
    for this is only available under NDA. Until it gets released to
    the public, this will remain unsupported.
    If you have docs for a CPU we don't support, write an XML spec
    for it and send them to powertweak-linux@lists.sourceforge.net

  Why do I need /dev/cpu/?/msr ?
  - rdmsr and wrmsr are priveledged ring 0 instructions which can
    only be executed in kernel space.

  Why do I need /dev/cpu/?/cpuid ?
  - There is no way to schedule instructions to individual CPUs
    in userspace. If this driver is missing, Powertweak will fall
	back to single CPU mode and issue cpuid instructions itself.

  Whats the problem with devfs ?
  - The cpuid & msr drivers are currently not devfs aware.
    Some vendor kernels may have extra patches to make them safe,
	but as these are not merged into the mainstream kernel,
	usage of devfs is discouraged.

PCI backend.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Why don't I get a 'tweaks' tab in the PCI backend ?
  - Your PCI devices are probably unsupported by Powertweak.
    Grab the datasheets for them, write XML descriptions and
    send them to powertweak-linux@lists.sourceforge.net


Elevator backend.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Why doesn't device XXX show up ?
  - It's a removable media device, and there was nothing
    in the drive at the time it was scanned.


IDE backend.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I see strange messages in my logs like..
    kernel: hde: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
    kernel: hde: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
  When I start up the daemon/UI, whats wrong with my hard disk ?
  - Some hard drives (notably IBM ones) don't like being asked
    "Are you SMART capable", and spit out these 'error' messages as
	a result. They're harmless and should just be ignored.


Profiles.
~~~~~~~~~
  What is a GUI profile ?
  - An XML file filled with settings for a 'role' your computer may play.
    Examples : "Router" "Webserver". These files adjust the settings in
	the GUI to optimal.

  What is an autoloaded profile ?
  - This is an XML file containing desired settings for an application.
    An example, an application can install a profile suggesting it would
	like XXX setting to be at least n.
