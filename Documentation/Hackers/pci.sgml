<chapter><title>PCI Backend</title>
<section><title>Context</title>
	<para>
		This document is intended for people that want to write
		plugins for <application>Powertweak Linux</application> that
		use the PCI core plugin.
		Note that you generally don't have to write a plugin if you
		want to add extra tweaks for a new chipset. Such additions should be
		added as a new <acronym>XML</acronym> file instead.
	</para>
	<para>	
		This document assumes a good knowledge of the C programming language, as Powertweak plugins are written in C.

<section><title>How does the PCI backend work?</title>
	<para>
		At the heart of PCI operations in Powertweak is PCILIB.
		This is a library provided with pciutils, that has been converted
		for use with Powertweak, and provided as a core plugin.
		Core plugins get loaded before normal plugins, so the first thing
		that a plugin dependant on using functionality provided by it
		is check that has successfully loaded.
	</para>

	<para><programlisting>
		if (have_core_plugin("libpcilib.so") == FALSE)
			return FALSE;
	</programlisting></para>
	<para>
		This allows Powertweak to unload the dependant plugin (saving memory)
		if the PCI core hasn't been loaded (For eg, on a system without a PCI bus).
</section>

<section>
	<title>What else do I need to know about the PCI backend?</title>
	<para>
		Unlike other backends, your plugin should not call RegisterTweak to add
		its tweaks to the tree. Instead, it should use the helper function
		AddTo_PCI_tree()
		This allows the PCI backend to register tweaks from different PCI backends
		in a uniform manner, taking care of issues like multiple devices with the
		same name, finding its class, finding its position in the tree etc..
