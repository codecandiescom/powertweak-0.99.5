Supporting extra hardware can be difficult at times.
Notably, when vendors decide to only give out datasheets
under NDA, or worse still, fail to make them available,
and refuse to answer your mails.

If you find support for your CPU / Chipset is missing,
it's likely that this is the reason why. (Or we haven't
got around to it yet).

If you'd like to see your hardware supported, check to
see if register level programming information is available,
from the vendors web/ftp site. If not, please feel free
to drop them a polite mail informing them of your
disappointment of their lack of support.


Currently unsupported:

AMD Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird   : Only available under NDA.
                                 Steps being taken to try and get some
								 stuff approved.

VIA PCI Chipsets               : VIA used to make all their datasheets
                                 available, now it seems only a select
								 few chipsets (mostly mature) and not
								 the full datasheets, but an editted
								 version of what used to be available.
								 -*no*- replies from any email to them.

Serverworks PCI Chipsets       : I had a nice reply from one of their
                                 engineers who said he'd be in touch,
								 I never heard from him nor anyone else
								 @serverworks again. Nothing available
								 on their web/ftp site.
