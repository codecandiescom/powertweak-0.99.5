Compiling Powertweak-Linux:
	./configure
	make
	su root
	make install

Next, run the configuration tool. Either the GTK tool "gpowertweak",
or the textmode tool "powertweak".
View (and change if desired) the settings, and choose 'Save'.

Next, you have a choice of behaviour.
Either

 a. Install the daemon "powertweakd" in your startup.
  or
 b. Install "powertweakd --no-daemon" in your startup.
    This will make the daemon load the plugins apply settings,
	and then exit.


Run-time dependancies:
 To run Powertweak (From a binary distribution, or self compiled version)
 - You will need at least version 2.1.0 of PCI utilities.
   Available from http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/pciutils.html
 - libXML
   You will need version 1.8.8 or 2.1.0.
   Available from http://www.libxml.org
 - If you want to build the GTK GUI config program, you will need
   GTK v1.2.0 or higher installed.
   Available from http://www.gtk.org

Compile-time dependancies:

 To build Powertweak from source, you will need...
 - libtool
 - autoconf
 - automake (1.4 only)
 - autoheader
 - libxml developer includes. (1.8.8+ or 2.1.0+)
 - GTK developer includes. (If GTK GUI is to be built)
 - GPM developer includes. (If mouse support is desired in textmode UI)

If the configure script is missing (or you get this from cvs) you can use 
the autogen.sh which will do its best to configure Makefiles for your setup. 
Then run make to build.
You will find the built dynamic libraries in the .libs dirs in each backend
