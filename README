Related mailing lists:

 - Powertweak Linux mail list
   This is principally for developers of Powertweak-Linux, but is also
   the place you should send any bug-reports, suggestions, requests
   e.t.c.
   For archives & (un)subscribing information, visit this URL:
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/powertweak-linux

 - Linux PCI utilities.
   Send "subscribe linux-pci Your Full Name" to
   listproc@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz 

   Release notes about pciutils will be sent to the list and problems
   with the Linux PCI support will be probably discussed there, too.

   *note*, that Powertweak currently uses a forked version of PCILIB
   based upon the current release with some extra fixes. If you have
   problems with Powertweak & PCI, you should report the bug to the
   Powertweak list first, as it may be related to one of our changes.
